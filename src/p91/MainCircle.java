/*
 * (1) What are the advantages of using lambda expressions instead of regular methods? 
 * The code becomes more readable. Thereâ€™s no need to create a separate class to implement them. Useful for single purpose methods. Fewer lines of code.
 * (2) Can you add more methods into the interface? If so, would make sense to do so?
 * Yes, you can add default/static methods but no more abstract methods. Default methods can be useful in functional interfaces, e.g., for helper methods.
